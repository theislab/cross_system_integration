# Analysis reproducibility

Below are described steps required for the reproduction of results from Hrovatin et al. 

For all python notebook files (ipynb) we also provide matching python (py) file conversion.

## Data preprocessing

Data for integration is prepared within _data_ directory:
- mouse-human: pancreas_conditions_MIA_HPAP2.ipynb
- organoid-tissue: retina_adult_organoid.ipynb
- cell-nuclei: adipose_sc_sn_updated.ipynb
