Potential use cases:
1. Comparison of cell types accross species: 
 - It seems that gamma cells may be more similar to alpha cells in mouse, but beta cells in human.
   This is also supported in Tritschler et al.  (2022) (see cell type correlation heatmap).
 - To validate this developmentally we could integrate mouse and human embryonic data (from Carina, later pig could be also added).
2. Subtype inference across species:
 - Human data is hard to analyse because of heterogeneity (lack of separation of beta cells from healthy and diabetic donors).
   Thus integrate mouse and human data and separate human cells into more healthy/diabetic like based on integrated mouse annotation.
3. Understanding organoids by integrating with real development.
